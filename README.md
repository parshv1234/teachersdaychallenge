# ðŸš€ Teachers' Day Challenge 2025 - VIT Bhopal

---

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Teachers' Day Challenge 2025**, an initiative by **PAT Cell VIT Bhopal**! This challenge is a 43-day coding journey, running from July 25th to September 5th (Teachers' Day), focused on consistency, growth, and upskilling in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

As a proud Lion of VIT Bhopal, I'm dedicating time each day to practice problem-solving, build confidence for technical interviews, and contribute to our vibrant coding community.

## About the Challenge

The Teachers' Day Challenge offers two tracks:
* **Beginner Track:** 43 problems
* **Advanced Track:** 86 problems (2 problems per day)

I'm committed to tackling problems from Beginner track to sharpen my DSA skills and maintain daily coding consistency. 

"Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out." This challenge perfectly embodies that philosophy, and I'm excited to see the progress each day brings.

## My Progress ðŸ“ˆ

Here, you'll find my solutions to the daily problems. I'll be updating this repository regularly with my code.

### Day 1 (July 25)
* **Beginner Track:** LeetCode 1295: Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

### Day 2 (July 26)
* **Beginner Track:** LeetCode 412: Fizz Buzz

### Day 3 (July 27)
* LeetCode 125: Valid Palindrome
    * **Note:** Solved using Python's `re.sub` for string cleaning. Observed a performance difference: a direct `return` statement for the palindrome check yielded ~3ms runtime, compared to ~6ms when using an explicit `if-else` block for the same logic.

### Day 4 (July 28)
* LeetCode 1: Two Sum
    * **Note:** Solved using the Hash Map approach for optimal efficiency. While other methods like brute-force or two-pointers (after sorting) exist, the hash map offers a clean O(n) average-time complexity. You'll find both the code and detailed notes on this problem's various solutions in this repository.

### **Day 5: Unraveling Roman Numerals! (LeetCode 13: Roman to Integer)**

* **Key Learnings:** This problem was a good exercise in working with permutations and reversing mappings. It reinforced the importance of careful array indexing and translating problem logic into a clean implementation.

### **Day 36: Lucky Division! (Codeforces 122A: Lucky Division)**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/122/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/122/A)
* **Solution Status:** Solved
* **Approach:** The solution pre-computes a list of all possible "lucky numbers" (numbers containing only the digits 4 and 7) within the given constraints. It then reads an integer `n` and checks if `n` is perfectly divisible by any number in the lucky numbers list.
* **Complexity:**
    * **Time Complexity:** O(1), as the number of lucky numbers to check is constant and small (a fixed list).
    * **Space Complexity:** O(1), to store the pre-computed list of lucky numbers.
* **Key Learnings:** Practiced a simple brute-force approach that is effective for problems with small constraints. This was a good reminder that a direct check can be more efficient than a complex algorithm when the search space is limited.

### **Day 37: HQ9+! (Codeforces 133A: HQ9+)**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/133/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/133/A)
* **Solution Status:** Solved
* **Approach:** The solution reads a string representing a program. It then checks for the presence of specific characters ('H', 'Q', or '9') which, according to the problem, are the only instructions that produce output. The solution returns "YES" if any of these characters are found, and "NO" otherwise.
* **Complexity:**
    * **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the string, as the `in` operator performs a linear search.
    * **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the program does not use any data structures that scale with the input size.
* **Key Learnings:** Practiced using a simple and direct approach to check for the presence of multiple characters within a string. This problem was a good exercise in interpreting a problem's specific rules and translating them into a single, elegant conditional check.

### **Day 38: I_love_%username%! (Codeforces 155A: I_love_%username%)**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/155/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/155/A)
* **Solution Status:** Solved
* **Approach:** The solution reads the number of contests `n` and a list of scores. It initializes `best` and `worst` scores with the first contest's score. It then iterates through the remaining scores, and for each score, it checks if it's strictly greater than the current `best` or strictly less than the current `worst`. If either condition is true, a counter for "amazing performances" is incremented, and the `best` or `worst` score is updated.
* **Complexity:**
    * **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of contests, as the solution involves a single pass through the list of scores.
    * **Space Complexity:** O(N), to store the list of scores in memory.
* **Key Learnings:** Practiced efficiently tracking dynamic minimum and maximum values within a single loop. The problem was a good exercise in applying simple conditional logic and updating state variables to solve a sequential data problem.

### **Day 39: Arrival of the General! (Codeforces 118A: Arrival of the General)**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/118/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/118/A)
* **Solution Status:** Solved
* **Approach:** The solution finds the first occurrence of the maximum height and the last occurrence of the minimum height in the line of soldiers. The total swaps required are calculated as the moves needed to bring the tallest soldier to the front plus the moves to bring the shortest soldier to the back. A special case is handled if the tallest soldier is originally to the right of the shortest, in which case one swap is counted for both.
* **Complexity:**
    * **Time Complexity:** O(N), as the solution involves three passes through the array: two to find the indices of the max and min values and one for the initial `max()` and `min()` calls.
    * **Space Complexity:** O(N), to store the list of soldier heights.
* **Key Learnings:** Practiced finding specific elements in an array and carefully handling edge cases. This problem was a great exercise in translating a logical, real-world scenario (swapping neighbors in a line) into a minimal-operations algorithm.

### **Day 40: George and Accommodation! (Codeforces 467A: George and Accommodation)**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/467/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/467/A)
* **Solution Status:** Solved
* **Approach:** The solution reads the total number of rooms `n`. It then iterates `n` times, reading the current number of people `p` and the room's capacity `q` for each room. The code checks if the number of available spots (`q - p`) is 2 or greater. A counter is incremented for each room that meets this condition.
* **Complexity:**
    * **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of rooms, as the code processes each room exactly once.
    * **Space Complexity:** O(1), as only a few variables are used to store the state during the loop.
* **Key Learnings:** Practiced a simple conditional counting loop, which is a fundamental programming pattern. The problem was a good exercise in translating a direct logical condition from the problem statement into a single `if` statement.

### **Day 41: Young Physicist! (Codeforces 69A: Young Physicist)**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/69/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/69/A)
* **Solution Status:** Solved
* **Approach:** The solution reads the number of force vectors `n` and then iterates `n` times to read the `x`, `y`, and `z` components of each vector. It maintains a running sum for each of the three coordinates. For a body to be in equilibrium, the sum of all x, y, and z forces must be zero. A final check confirms that all three coordinate sums are zero.
* **Complexity:**
    * **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of force vectors. The code processes each vector's components once.
    * **Space Complexity:** O(1), as only a few variables are used to store the running sums and the input.
* **Key Learnings:** Practiced translating a real-world physics problem (equilibrium of forces) into a simple coding solution. The problem reinforced the importance of summing up components independently and applying a basic conditional check to solve a problem involving vectors.
