# ðŸš€ Teachers' Day Challenge 2025 - VIT Bhopal

---

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Teachers' Day Challenge 2025**, an initiative by **PAT Cell VIT Bhopal**! This challenge is a 43-day coding journey, running from July 25th to September 5th (Teachers' Day), focused on consistency, growth, and upskilling in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

As a proud Lion of VIT Bhopal, I'm dedicating time each day to practice problem-solving, build confidence for technical interviews, and contribute to our vibrant coding community.

## About the Challenge

The Teachers' Day Challenge offers two tracks:
* **Beginner Track:** 43 problems
* **Advanced Track:** 86 problems (2 problems per day)

I'm committed to tackling problems from Beginner track to sharpen my DSA skills and maintain daily coding consistency. 

"Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out." This challenge perfectly embodies that philosophy, and I'm excited to see the progress each day brings.

## My Progress ðŸ“ˆ

Here, you'll find my solutions to the daily problems. I'll be updating this repository regularly with my code.

### Day 1 (July 25)
* **Beginner Track:** LeetCode 1295: Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

### Day 2 (July 26)
* **Beginner Track:** LeetCode 412: Fizz Buzz

### Day 3 (July 27)
* LeetCode 125: Valid Palindrome
    * **Note:** Solved using Python's `re.sub` for string cleaning. Observed a performance difference: a direct `return` statement for the palindrome check yielded ~3ms runtime, compared to ~6ms when using an explicit `if-else` block for the same logic.

### My Commitment

A special thanks to our Placement Director, **Shriram R**, for his constant motivation and guidance. His dedication truly helps us all aim higher and dream bigger.

I'm Parshv Modi, and I'm committed to continuous learning, challenging myself, and growing as a developer.
